      A computer is an electronic machine that can store, organize, and find
      information, do calculations, play music and games, and control other
      machines. It also can perform many other functions. But the computer has
      no capacity to do anything by itself. However, nowadays, many software
      like virtual assistants can handle a computer. A computer generally works
      on the basis of commands given by the operator. The invention of the
      computer has a long history. Scientists did not invent it overnight. It
      took a long time and hard labor to invent the computer. A computer has
      five major components. These components are the input unit 2. the output
      unit 3. the memory unit 4. the control unit, and 5. the arithmetic unit.
      Besides, a computer performs three basic functions. Firstly, it receives
      data. Secondly, it processes data from various computations. And thirdly
      it emits data.
